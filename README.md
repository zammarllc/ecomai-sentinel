# Project Monorepo

## Overview

This repository is the starting point for a full-stack monorepo that will eventually host the web frontend, backend APIs, and shared utilities. The current scaffold establishes a consistent directory structure, shared tooling configuration, and documentation so that future contributions can focus on feature development.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**
   - TODO: Document dependency installation once package manifests are finalized.
2. **Run Development Servers**
   - TODO: Provide commands for running the frontend and backend workspaces.
3. **Generate Builds**
   - TODO: Outline the build process for all workspaces.

## Project Structure

```
frontend/   # Web client workspace (TODO: initialize framework)
backend/    # API server workspace (TODO: add server implementation)
shared/     # Shared code and utilities reused across workspaces
```

## Workspace Management

- The root `package.json` configures npm workspaces for `frontend` and `backend`.
- TODO: Add scripts for linting, formatting, and testing across workspaces once tools are selected.

## Environment Configuration

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values before running any services.
- TODO: Expand environment variable documentation with service-specific requirements.

## Roadmap & TODOs

- TODO: Initialize the frontend framework (e.g., React, Next.js, Vite, etc.).
- TODO: Scaffold the backend service with routing, database integration, and auth.
- TODO: Add automated testing, linting, and formatting workflows.
- TODO: Expand shared utilities with reusable modules and publish strategy.
