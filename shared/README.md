# Shared Workspace

Shared modules and utilities that can be consumed by the frontend and backend workspaces.

## Structure

- `utils/` â€“ TODO: Add reusable helper functions, types, and adapters.

## TODO
- Establish package build tooling (e.g., TypeScript configuration, bundlers).
- Decide on publishing strategy (local packages, npm, or internal registry).
- Add tests and documentation for shared modules.
